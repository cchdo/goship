      <strong>GO-SHIP Development Plan Finalized</strong><br>

      <p>
        The GO-SHIP development plan outlines priorities and timelines for
        coordinating national hydrography programs into a global coordinated
        network, and the organizational framework and budget required to develop a
        sustained program. The Plan will be published by early 2011.

      <strong>Open sea and Ice trials for new icebreaker Araon.</strong><br>

      <p>
        The Korean Polar Research Institute (KORPI) launched its  new research
        icebreaker the <em>Araon</em> in January with open sea and ice trials
        between Christchurch and Cape Burks Antarctica.&nbsp;  The Araon
        (&ldquo;ara&rdquo;=sea; &ldquo;on&rdquo;=all) has been designed to
        carry out  multidisciplinary research in the Arctic and Antarctic
        regions and to provide  logistics support for Antarctic research
        stations.&nbsp; International cooperation is sought for  future
        research programs.&nbsp; For more  information, download the Araon

      <strong>GO-SHIP Text Adopted at JCOMM 3.</strong><br>

      <p>
        The following text was adopted at the 3rd session (November 2009) of
        the <a href="http://www.jcomm.info/" target="_blank">IOC-WMO Joint
          Technical Commission on Oceanography and Marine Meteorology
          (JCOMM)</a>:
      </p>
       
      <p>
        &quot;6.1.12.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Commission welcomed the
        progress made by the IOCCP-CLIVAR Global  Ocean Ship-based Hydrographic
        Investigations Panel (GO-SHIP), which brought  together interests from
        physical hydrography, carbon, biogeochemistry, Argo,  OceanSITES, and
        other users and collectors of hydrographic data to develop  guidelines
        and advice for the development of a globally coordinated network of
        sustained ship-based hydrographic sections that would become an
        integral  component of the ocean observing system.&nbsp;  These
        guidelines, including a strategy for the next global survey, were
        presented at the OceanObs&rsquo;09 conference and the community
        consensus was to move  forward with the development of a sustained
        coordination effort for repeat  hydrography.&nbsp; The Commission
        supported  this initiative and noted that IOCCP and CLIVAR have
        developed an oversight  committee to move this forward with the goal of
        presenting a plan for a  sustained coordination effort to the next
        session of the UNESCO/IOC Executive  Council for endorsement.&nbsp; The
        Commission  also welcomed the GO-SHIP revision of the 1994 WOCE
        Hydrographic Programme  Manual, which would be published electronically
        in January 2010.&quot;

      <strong>Welcome to the new GO-SHIP Web-site</strong><br>

      <p>
        Following open community discussions at the OceanObs'09 Conference
        (21-25 September 2009), the GO-SHIP Panel recommended to sponsors IOCCP
        and CLIVAR the development of a sustained global program for
        coordination of ship-based repeat hydrography. An essential element of
        this coordination is communication. This web-site is intended to serve
        as an international forum for news and information for the repeat
        hydrography community with the goals of improving communication among
        research groups, limiting gaps and duplications in sections,
        harmonizing the suite of variables measured and methods used, and
        facilitating data sharing and joint scientific syntheses.
