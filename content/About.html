<h1>About GO-SHIP</h1>
<p>
  Despite numerous  technological advances over the last several decades,
  ship-based hydrography  remains the only method for obtaining high-quality,
  high spatial and vertical  resolution measurements of a suite of physical,
  chemical, and biological  parameters over the full water column.&nbsp;
  Ship-based hydrography is  essential for documenting ocean changes throughout
  the water column, especially  for the deep ocean below 2 km (52% of global
  ocean volume not sampled by  profiling floats).
</p>
<p>
  Global hydrographic  surveys have been carried out approximately every decade
  since the 1970s  through research programs such as GEOSECS, TTO/SAVE, WOCE /
  JGOFS, and  CLIVAR.&nbsp; However, global repeat hydrography  has lacked
  formal global organization since the end of WOCE and this  has led to a lack
  of visibility for hydrography in the global observing  system as well as a
  significant decrease in the number of trans-basin sections carried  out by
  some countries. More importantly, the lack of international agreements  for
  implementation of hydrographic sections has led to disparate data sharing
  policies, duplication of some sections, and sections being carried out
  without  the full suite of core variables.
</p>
<p>
  The Global Ocean Ship-based Hydrographic Investigations Program (GO-SHIP)
  brings together scientists with interests in physical oceanography, the
  carbon cycle, marine biogeochemistry and ecosystems, and other users and
  collectors of ocean interior data to develop a sustained global network of
  hydrographic sections as part of the Global Ocean / Climate Observing System.
</p>
<p>
  The GO-SHIP Panel was established in 2007 by the IOCCP and CLIVAR to develop
  a strategy for a sustained global repeat hydrography program as a
  contribution to the OceanObs09 Conference (September 2009) and to revise the
  1994 WOCE hydrographic program manual. Based on community discussions at the
  OceanObs09 Conference, the Panel recommended the  development of a sustained
  repeat hydrography program to:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <em>develop</em>
    formal international agreements for a sustained international repeat
    ship-based  hydrography program, including an internationally-agreed
    strategy and  implementation plan building on the guidelines in the
    Community White Paper,
  </li>

  <li>
    <em>advocate</em>
    for national contributions to this strategy and participation in the global
    program,
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>provide</em>
    a central forum for communication and coordination, and
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>develop</em>
    syntheses of hydrographic data, in partnership with national, regional, and
    global research programs.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  The IOCCP and CLIVAR International Project Offices have agreed to provide
  project office support to this program as it develops.
</p>
<p>
  Project office support for GO-SHIP is provided by the IOC-SCOR International
  Ocean Carbon Coordination Project (IOCCP) and the Climate Variability and
  Predictability Project (CLIVAR).  Major financial support for this project is
  provided by the U.S. National Science  Foundation through a grant to UNESCO -
  IOC (OCE - 0715161) and a grant  to the Scientific Committee on Oceanic
  Research (OCE - 0608600) for the IOCCP.

    The development of a sustained program for repeat hydrography was supported
    by the 3rd session (November 2009) of the IOC-WMO Joint Technical
    Commission on Oceanography and Marine Meteorology (JCOMM). The GO-SHIP
    committee is currently drafting a Development Plan for consideration by
    potential sponsors and/or program office hosts.
