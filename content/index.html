  GO-SHIP brings together scientists with interests in physical oceanography, the
  carbon cycle, marine biogeochemistry and ecosystems, and other users and
  collectors of hydrographic data to develop a globally coordinated network of
  sustained hydrographic sections as part of the global ocean/climate observing
  system.

      The GO-SHIP Panel has finalized the GO-SHIP Development Plan, which
      outlines priorities and timelines for coordinating national hydrography
      programs into a global coordinated network, and the organizational
      framework and budget required to develop a sustained program. The Plan
      will be published by early 2011.
      </p>

      <p>
        With the completion of the Development Plan, Maria Hood will be
        stepping down as GO-SHIP Project Coordinator for a sabbatical. IOCCP
        Project Coordinator Kathy Tedesco will serve as GO-SHIP coordinator
        until a Program Office can be established.

        Dr. Robert 'Bob' Molinari has been appointed as the new ICPO Director
        to replace Dr. Howard Cattle. During his 34-year career at NOAA's
        Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory, Bob served as   a
        Supervisory Oceanographer, Director of AOML's Physical   Oceanography
        Division and AOML's Global Ocean Observing   System (GOOS) Center.  He
        served as Chief Scientist   on more than 35 cruises to the Atlantic,
        Indian and Pacific   Oceans, and will be a great asset to GO-SHIP as it
        transitions to a sustained program.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also bid farewell to Kate Stansfield who has left the CLIVAR IPO to
        return to research. Kate has been a great help in getting GO-SHIP up
        and running and we wish her all the best.

      The 2011 and 2012 German AR02 cruises have berths available for groups
      doing nutrients and carbon. This section was occupied in 2007 (full
      section) and the western part  was reoccupied in 2009.&nbsp; Funding
      exists for reoccupations in 2010-2013.  For more information, contact
      Monika Rhein:
      <a href="mailto:mrhein@physik.uni-bremen.de">mrhein@physik.uni-bremen.de</a>.
      For participation in the 2011 cruise, please notify Monika no later than
      October 2010. For the 2012 cruise, notification is needed by November
      2011.

      The Third South Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (SAMOC)
      workshop will take place in Niteroi/Rio, Brazil, on May 11, 12 and 13,
      2010. SAMOC 3 plans to get together international experts to design and
      plan the South Atlantic and inter-ocean exchanges element of an MOC
      observing system that would help address questions and challenges
      outlined in the documents and recommendations provided by
      OceanObs&rsquo;09. It is expected that the workshop will foster
      international collaborations and will provide concrete basis for the
      implementation of the program. For more information, visit the workshop
